## Grabbing a Weekly Solution

[Over the course of the module we are going to begin the process of making a goal tracking application](https://www.figma.com/file/rTbqRpRWOw7UYg28SBcxQv/web-dev-pratical-task-made-using-toxin-ui?node-id=31262%3A3). We start this journey in week2, hence the solutions start from week 2.

Each weekly solution is held in a isolated git branch (e.g., `week-2-solutions`). To get going colone your weekly solution of choice. Next, from the root of the project, run:
- `cd running-contemp-web-app-solutions`
-  `npm install`. You can then start the application `npm run start`.

**To clone a solution, run the following command from your terminal:**

| Week | Command                                                                                                |
